  <h4><b>Bio</b></h4>
  <p>
      <br> I am a Masters Student at USC, majoring in Computer Science, where I am working with Professor  <a href=https://xuezhemax.github.io target="_blank">Xuezhe Ma</a> and PhD student <a href=http://charismaticchiu.github.io target="_blank">MingChang Chiu</a> .
      <br>
      <p>    
        
        Before coming to USC, I received my Bachelor of Arts (Honors) degree in Computer Science at New York University, where I worked with Professor  <a href=https://cims.nyu.edu/~sondjaja/ target="_blank">Mutiara Sondjaja</a>.
      </p> 
    
  </p>
  <p>I am generally interested in applied Machine Learning, but I became recently more interested in various fields of Computer Vision, mostly in regards to self-driving cars, and 3D vision.

      <b> NYU Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund recepient(September 2018 ~ May 2020)</b>
      <p>-Implemented K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) algorithms from scratch on breast cancer cell data set and least squares for
      classification on a manually created data set.</p>
      <p>-Implemented Naive-Bayes Algorithm on complex data such as blood cell images and simpler data
        such as images of handwritten digits(0-9).</p>     
      <p>-Studied the theoretical mathematics behind Support Vector Machines(SVM) and Naive Bayes Algorithm.</p> 
      <p>-Experimented with Interior Point Method(IPM) and the challenges involved if the number of input points
        is scaled up. On a training data set that has binary labels, formulated a Support Vector Machine
        Quadratic Program, using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions to convert the program into a linear system. </p> 
      <p>-Used a log barrier to ensure that the iterations of the IPM problem stay within the feasible region.</p>
        
      <p>-With the newly evolved constraints, attempted to find the optimal hyperplane that classifies the modified problem.</p>
      <p>-Submitted my thesis to Professor Sondjaja for review.</p>

      <b>Timeline: (January 2022~ Present)</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b><i>Analysis of Deepfake Detection Algorithms</i></b>
      <br>
      <p> -Analyzed Deepfake Detection Algorithms by lowering the resolution of images in Deepfake Datasets
        to see if there are any common clues or features to detect Deepfakes. If there are such features, then there would be a more robust approach to detect such fake images.</p>

        <p>-Explored large datasets by applying models such as ResNet, MesoNet, and Xception-Net.</p>
        <p>-Experimented with using adversarial training to improve model robustness and clean data accuracy.</p> 
        <p>-Retrained the models using darkened images perturbed with Gaussian noise.</p>

      <b><i>Study of Machine Vision Robustness</i></b>
      <p> - Analyzed Human Visual Contrast Sensitivity by creating a new framework based on model architecture and model size to measure the perception ability of machine vision beyond total accuracy</p>
      <p> - Attempted to address shortcomings in machine vision in terms of contrast sensitivity.</p>
      <p> - Curated datasets CIFAR10â€“F and CIFAR100-F based on foreground colors, and CIFAR10-B and CIFAR100-B based on background colors, and these datasets acted as a proxy to understand color vision.</p>
      <p> - Mirrored the adaptations of human vision to ambient light by using corrupted images from the CIFAR-C dataset.</p>
      <p> - Showed how color differences affect model perception in CNNs, and we did further analysis of this effect on various model architectures, model sizes, corruptions, and augmentations and demonstrated that there is a reliance on contrast in CNNs. </p>

      <p> - Submitted a paper to CVPR and under review - third author</p>    
      <b>On Human Visual Contrast Sensitivity and Machine Vision Robustness: A Comparative Study</b> <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08650 target="_blank"> PDF</a>
